 Dataset Management Platform using Django
 
 See it in action here https://dataset-m-p.herokuapp.com/
 
 Or if you would rather see the magic for yourself:
 1. You need (preferably the latest version of) Python, including pip, and Django. You might want to add the Python to your HOME PATH.
 2. clone the files to a directory
 3. run "pip install django"
 4. go to the directory (where manage.py is located)
 5. run "python manage.py makemigrations" and "python manage.py migrate"
 6. if there are no errors, you can run "python manage.py createsuperuser" and follow its procedure to create an admin account
 7. run "python manage.py runserver" and go to the address 127.0.0.1:8000 on your browser

The styling is just CSS.
